I used a custom client to securely upload some critical files to my backup server. 
Everything worked perfectly, until I forgot the credentials. Now I’m locked out of my own data. 
All I have left is the client binary, a few log files, and a packet capture of the upload session. 
The files are in there somewhere… if you can find a way to extract them.
